Implementation of the paper: Deep Bayesian Active Learning with Image Data by Yarin Gal et.al.

The code is mostly a cleaned up version of the original code by Riashat Islam: https://github.com/Riashat/Active-Learning-Bayesian-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

I just tweaked the code a little bit to make it run faster.
